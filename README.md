How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that software is both functional and secure, I focus on rigorous testing and code review throughout the development process. I use unit tests, integration tests, and system tests to verify that each component performs as expected and that all features work together properly. Security is maintained by following best practices such as input validation, proper authentication and authorization controls, encryption of sensitive data, and dependency management to avoid vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews, static analysis tools, and penetration testing help identify and mitigate potential risks early in development

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and feedback sessions. I then translate these needs into functional and non-functional requirements that can be implemented in code. Creating user stories and use cases helps ensure that every feature aligns with what the user expects. During development, I keep an open feedback loop with users or clients through prototypes or demos, adjusting features as necessary to ensure the final product meets their goals effectively.

### **How do I approach designing software?**

When designing software, I begin by analyzing the **problem domain** and defining clear objectives for what the system should accomplish. I then apply principles of **modular design, scalability, and maintainability** to structure the solution logically. Tools like **UML diagrams, flowcharts, and pseudocode** help visualize how components will interact. I also choose the most appropriate architecture—such as layered, microservices, or event-driven—based on the project’s size and complexity. Throughout design, I prioritize clarity, reusability, and simplicity to create a system that’s easy to extend and debug.
